    TYPO3 Flow is not a pick'n'mix store of motley components. It's a
    framework which helps you with the infrastructure of your application.
    Object Lifecycle Management, Package Management, Resource Management
    and Security are on it's home field. Real business logic is left to
    custom packages.
