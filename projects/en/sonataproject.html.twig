        The goal of the Sonata Project is to provide an e-commerce framework
        solution based on the Symfony framework. Think of it as a toolkit based
        on Symfony components to make building e-commerce sites easy and fun!
        Famous bundles are already available: Admin Bundle, Block Bundle, Media
        Bundle, ... and used by others projects like the Symfony CMF.
