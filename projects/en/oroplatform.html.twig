        The Oro Platform is an Open source Business Application Platform (BAP).
        It offers developers the exact business application platform they've
        been looking for, by combining the tools they need. Built in PHP5 and
        the Symfony2 framework, it seamlessly integrates into OroCRM or works
        entirely standalone. Developing custom business applications has never
        been so easy.
