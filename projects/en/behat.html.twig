        Behat is an open source behavior-driven development framework for PHP
        5.3 and 5.4. What is behavior-driven development, you ask? It's the
        idea that you start by writing human-readable sentences that describe
        a feature of your application and how it should work, and only then
        implement this behavior in software.
