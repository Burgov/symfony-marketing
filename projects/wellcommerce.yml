    WellCommerce is a modern open source e-commerce platform, which has been
    created from scratch on Symfony Full-stack framework, with a background
    of many years of experience gained through creation and development of 2
    e-commerce platforms and dedicated implementations for small family
    firms and large corporations, whom we had the pleasure to work with. Key
    features are: multi-store functionality, multi-language and multi-
    currency support, hassle-free management of shop catalogue,
    configuration, products variants, orders and clients, responsive default
    theme.
