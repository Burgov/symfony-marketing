    Mothership is open source web retail software, combining e-commerce with
    Electronic Point of Sale (EPOS) into a single, unified platform with a
    great admin interface. It is based on over 10 years experience, yet it
    is entirely new, containing zero legacy code, making it a perfect
    platform for developers. It incorporates the full range of applications
    you'd expect to run an online store. Mothership: E-commerce for humans.
