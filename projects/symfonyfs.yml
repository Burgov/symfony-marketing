    Symfony is an Open Source PHP Web applications development framework.
    It was originally conceived by the interactive agency SensioLabs for
    the development of web sites for its own customers. Symfony was
    published by the agency in 2005 under MIT Open Source license and today
    it is among the leading frameworks available for PHP development.
