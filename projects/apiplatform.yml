description: |
    API Platform is an Open Source web framework for API-first projects.
    Describe the API's data model or import an existing one from Schema.org
    and get instantly a fully featured read/write API with REST operations,
    data validation, pagination, sorting, filtering, Swagger documentation,
    an authorization system, invalidation-based HTTP cache, nested documents,
    content negotiation and support for modern hypermedia formats (JSON-LD,
    HAL and Hydra).
    Open your preferred editor then customize and override everything you need.
    Use the provided JavaScript tools to bootstrap a Single Page Application
    or a mobile app using React from the API description.
