    Amazon Instant Access (AIA), is a fulfillment technology for virtual content
    that is purchased on the Amazon web site and needs to be delivered to a third
    party server. The Amazon Instant Access SDK enables PHP developers to easily
    integrate their systems and onboard with the AIA system.
