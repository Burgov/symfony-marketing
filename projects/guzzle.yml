    Guzzle takes the pain out of sending HTTP requests and the redundancy
    out of creating web service clients. It's a framework that includes
    the tools needed to create a robust web service client, including:
    Service descriptions for defining the inputs and outputs of an API,
    resource iterators for traversing paginated resources, batching for
    sending a large number of requests as efficiently as possible.
